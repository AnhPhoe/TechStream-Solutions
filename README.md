## Unit Economics Analysis – TechStream Solutions
### 1 Project Overview
This repository contains a full-cycle data analytics project focused on analyzing the Unit Economics of a fictional SaaS company, TechStream Solutions. It demonstrates practical application of business metrics, including:

- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Gross Margin
- LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)
- LTV/CAC Ratio
Developed in Google Colab using Python and Pandas, this project follows the structure of a real-world analytics case. It is designed to be reproducible, insightful, and aligned with industry best practices.
### 2 Key Objectives
- Extract and transform data from various sources (marketing, payroll, expenses, customer behavior)
- Calculate business-critical metrics that drive profitability
- Interpret insights and recommend strategic improvements
- Showcase a complete ETL and insight pipeline for employers
### 3  Datasets Used

#### 4 Methods & Process
##### 4.1 Data Loading & Cleaning
- Extracted from Google Sheets using pandas.read_excel()
- Standardized date formats, filled missing values
- Filtered datasets by target month (March 2023)
##### 4.2 Metric Calculations
🧠 CAC – Customer Acquisition Cost
CAC = (CRM + Sales Salary + Marketing Salary + Ad Spend) / New Customers

💳 ARPU – Average Revenue Per User
ARPU = Total Revenue / Unique Customers

🧮 COGS – Cost of Goods Sold
Includes:
- Software costs (AWS, GCP, Jira)
- Communication tools (Slack, Zoom – allocated 60%)
- Engineering salaries

📐 Gross Margin
Gross Margin (%) = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue \* 100

🔁 LTV – Life Time Value
LTV = ARPU × Avg Lifespan (in months) × Gross Margin / 100

⚖️ LTV/CAC Ratio
Benchmarks the efficiency of marketing spend.

#### 5  Results Summary

#### 6 Insights & Recommendations

🔺 High CAC (>$1200) relative to LTV → risk of unsustainable growth
✅ Strong Gross Margin (75.6%) indicates product is cost-efficient
💡 LTV/CAC ratio below industry benchmark (3:1)
→ Marketing spend is not generating high-value customers effectively

- Recommended Actions:
Reallocate ad budget to more efficient channels (e.g., Google Ads vs Meta)
Improve onboarding and retention to increase LTV
Optimize acquisition funnel or offer freemium trials to lower CAC

 Skills Demonstrated
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas)
✅ Business Metric Modeling (CAC, LTV, etc.)
✅ Real-World Data Simulation from Google Sheets
✅ Documentation & Insight Communication
✅ Reproducibility using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
